# 🚀 my-portfolio

> A visually-rich 3D developer portfolio powered by Three.js, GSAP, and modern frontend tools — built as a learning playground and a personal showcase.

## ✨ About the Project

This portfolio project was my dive into **Three.js** and **GSAP animations**. While I followed a helpful tutorial for the base, I’ve added my own touches and made it responsive, interactive, and visually engaging. Plus, I didn’t have a portfolio before — so this was the perfect excuse to build one!
