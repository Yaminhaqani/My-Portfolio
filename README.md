## ✨ About the Project

This portfolio project was my dive into **Three.js** and **GSAP animations**. While I followed a helpful tutorial for the base, I’ve added my own touches and made it responsive, interactive, and visually engaging. Plus, I didn’t have a portfolio before — so this was the perfect excuse to build one!
